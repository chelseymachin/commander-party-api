# Commander Party API üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

A Flask-based API for analyzing Magic: The Gathering Commander (EDH) decks. This project uses the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) to fetch card data and provides a detailed breakdown of a deck‚Äôs structure, including ramp, interaction, card draw, recursion, tribal synergy, and commander identity.

Can be hit live at the following url: 'https://commander-party-api-production.up.railway.app'

Try it out in Postman!

## API Endpoint

### `POST /analyzeDeck`

Analyzes a submitted Commander deck list and returns structured analysis results.

---

### Request Body

Send a JSON object with a `deck` field containing an array of card names.  The first card in the deck NEEDS to be your commander.  This is pretty standard in deck export/imports for commanders as it's pretty hard to determine which individual card COULD be a commander for the deck.

```json
{
  "deck": [
    "YourCommanderHere"
    "Sol Ring",
    "Cultivate",
    "Command Tower",
    "Tatyova, Benthic Druid",
    "Rampant Growth"
  ]
}
```

---

### Response Format

Returns a JSON object with deck breakdown results:

## Features

- **Ramp Analysis** ‚Äì Detects ramp cards via Scryfall oracle tags and keyword logic
- **Interaction Breakdown** ‚Äì Identifies removal, wipes, counterspells, and graveyard hate
- **Card Draw Analysis** ‚Äì Finds cards that increase hand size or provide draw advantage
- **Tribal Synergy Detection** ‚Äì Determines common tribes and tribal-supporting cards
- **Recursion Detection** ‚Äì Analyzes cards that bring permanents/spells back from the graveyard
- **Commander Insight** ‚Äì Pulls out commander identity, type, text, and colors
- **Mana Curve Metrics** ‚Äì Calculates average and max mana costs and generates a histogram

---

## Performance

To reduce Scryfall API calls and improve performance:
- Oracle tag datasets (e.g., `ramp`, `removal`, `draw`) are **preloaded and cached** in memory at app startup
- Individual card fetches are **cached in memory** for the duration of the app runtime
- Multithreaded fetching accelerates large deck lookups to avoid waiting for sequential calls
